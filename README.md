# Covid-19-leisure-travel
In this report, I will be completing a data wrangling and analysis on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on leisure travel behaviour.

The Covid-19 pandemic has largely prohibited UK domestic and international travel since March 2020 to cull and contain its impact. As deaths related to Covid-19 have reduced and vaccination uptake has increased, the UK Government has started the process of easing lockdown rules and this includes gradually lifting travel restrictions with a traffic light system. While there is a sense of increasing anticipation and eagerness for travel to resume widely within the media, the UK Government is treading carefully with a small list of green list approved travel destinations. This list will ultimately grow, and domestic freedoms will return. As this happens, it will pose UK citizens with a choice to travel in a world where the Covid-19 pandemic is very much still present. With health and safety concerns paramount, and various rules and precautions on society in place, the purpose of this analysis is to to understand the public sentiment towards leisure travel.
